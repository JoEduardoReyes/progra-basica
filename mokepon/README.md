## 🔥🌱💧 Welcome to the Arena!

**Mokepon** is a simple browser game inspired by the classic turn-based Pokémon battles, built using only vanilla JavaScript and HTML.  
This is version **1.0**, the foundation of the project developed during the [Platzi Basic Programming Course](https://platzi.com/), as part of my personal journey to master web development.

## 🧠 About the Project

After a long break from coding, this is one of my first completed projects to re-ignite my skills. The project covers:

- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Conditionals and loops
- Game logic with lives, random enemy actions, and victory conditions
- Clean, readable structure and separation of logic

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay

- Choose one of three pets: **Hipodoge**, **Capipepo**, or **Ratigueya**
- Select your attacks: 🔥 Fire, 💧 Water, or 🌱 Earth
- The enemy selects their pet and attacks randomly
- Each player starts with 3 lives – win by reducing the enemy's lives to zero

---

## 📁 Files

- `mokepon.html`: The UI layout, including all buttons and display sections.
- `mokepon.js`: The game logic, including attack handling, life tracking, and win conditions.

> This version does **not** use CSS or backend yet. It's all in-browser and pure logic.
