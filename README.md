## 🧠 About this Project

This repository documents my journey through the **Basic Programming Course** by [Platzi](https://platzi.com/), as part of a personal reboot called **Tomorrow 2.0**. After a year away from coding, I'm diving back in—not from scratch, but from a new level of clarity and determination.

> "This is not just a restart. It's a system update."

My goal is to reinforce the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building a portfolio of mini-projects, especially the iconic **Mokepon Game**. Each commit represents a milestone in my learning, with notes, comments, and improvements from my fresh perspective.
